# Machine Learning Engineering Project

The purpose of this project is to deploy a machine learning model in a production ready environment. In order to do that, the following technologies will be used:

* `FastApi` for model deployment
* `Kubernetes` as underlying compute layer
* `Docker` to containerize such model
* `Airflow` to schedule training and inference jobs
